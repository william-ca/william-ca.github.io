Like many people around the world, the past year has given me the time and reason to evaluate the things I am doing in life, and look for areas where I can better myself and shape my life. For the past 5 years I have been working for a medical logistics company as a courier/manager. This job means many hours on the road driving, away from my home and wife. It has taught me many lessons, however I knew that the job's restrictions on where my family could live, and skills that weren't easily transferable to another career, meant that I needed to seriously look at other options.

I wanted my journey in a new career path to align with something I knew I would be passionate about. Having started a few businesses in my past I have an inate entrepreneurial spirit. I love technology and innovation. I'm interested in cryptography, economics, and Bitcoin. I wanted a skill that is highly transferrable to allow me and my family to maximalize on opportunities. With all of those things considered, choosing to study software development was a relatively easy choice. Starting from ground zero, I look forward to gaining knowledge that I can build on and use to end up in a career that I truely love and am passionate about.
